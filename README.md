# crowd-sourcing
Tool for crowd-sourcing annotations developed as a part of my MS thesis


1) Make sure that you install python flask.
Find instructions here : http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/installation/

2) Also install any missing dependencies. 

3) "cd crowd-sourcing" -> Run "python app.py"

4) This starts a localhost connection which allows you to use the interface and modify the database locally. 

The work will be hosted on our research lab website soon.
